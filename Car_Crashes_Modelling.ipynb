    "## 1. Problem objective\n",
    "#### Chicago experiences plenty of traffic crashes annually which ends up negatively impacting lives, property, and urban efficiency. As a way to best plan and reduce the crashes what can be done is to pinpoint where crashes cluster colliqually termed as black spots, and the factors that drive teh same, so that resources and the causes can be assessed to reduce accidents. Ideally, that is in line with the problem statement \"To pinpoint high-risk locations and uncover the human, vehicle, and environmental conditions that are majorly associated to accidents.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Exploration (Key Insights)\n",
    "#### From the analysis, most accidents happen during rush hour periods which is around 3PM to 7PM with the weekends having variations but a common factor being that they occur at night, but Saturdays being a constant figure with the highest number of crashes. While considering the crash severity, most crashes majorly involved property damage with a many having injuries and more interestingly for a 2million crash data low deaths which is actually commendable. Most crashes involve passenge type vehicles with motorcycle crashes and trucks having a low count but have significanlty higher severity rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Patterns and Hotspots\n",
    "#### Altough I'm not consident with my spatial interpretation, I will still do my best since it involves visual cues,it shouldnt be that difficult. Now, the crash density is not quite uniform with majority of it being concentrated in the dowtown regions with dense traffic and pedestrians, major intersection and arterial roads, and entertainment districts which majorly happends during weekends. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Contributing Factors\n",
    "#### Human factors involve situations where the driver was distracted while driving and alcohol related crashes spike at night, at the same time the you younger drivers are quite overrepresented in injury-causing crashes. Vehicle factors such as SUVs and Sedans dominate the number of high accidentc, and crashes involving motorcycles have the highest injury severity rate, Ironically when it comes to environmental factors, most crashes occur when the weather is mostly clear which asserts the notion that bad driving behaviour matters more than rain or snow. Also, poorly lit areas or intersections have significantly higher crash risks which was a very expected insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Predictive Modeling \n",
    "#### While descriptive analysis identifies past crash hotspots, we also explored whether machine learning can flag likely future hotspots based on location and crash attributes. Defined hotspots as the top 5% most crash-dense grid cells.\n",
    "#### Features included time, location bins, vehicle type, driver attributes, weather, and lighting.\n",
    "#### Tested models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM (baseline implementation).\n",
    "#### Result:\n",
    "#### Models reached ~85–90% accuracy, but struggled with precision on rare hotspots (too few positives compared to negatives).\n",
    "#### Interpretation: Predicting exact hotspot cells is difficult without richer urban features (traffic flow, road geometry, enforcement data).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Recommendations & Next Steps\n",
    "#### The data highlights clear interventions for the city and for further research.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### City-Level Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target Enforcement & Awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Focus traffic enforcement during evening rush hours and weekend nights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prioritize young drivers with awareness campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Infrastructure Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Invest in better lighting at crash-prone intersections.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Redesign top hotspot intersections (traffic calming, pedestrian protection).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data-Driven Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Require ride-share & delivery services to share driving data (these fleets may be overrepresented).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consider stricter penalties for night-time alcohol-related driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analytical Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrate road network data (speed limits, lane counts).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Include traffic volume data (exposure-adjusted risk, not just raw crash counts).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expand prediction work with deep learning spatial models if data allows."
